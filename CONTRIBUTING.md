## Making a pull request
1. Get in contact with one of our contributors for more specific requests, but feel free to make suggestions via issues, email, etc.
2. Try to maintain a similar coding style to that of our already existing files in the project (see specifics below).
3. Ensure that you make a pull request from your fork to the Master branch when you fork the repository.
4. Make sure your requests have not already been addressed/appealed by other contributors of the project.
5. Keep track of your request after submission for any suggestions and updates regarding implementation.

## How you can help
One of the best ways to contribute to this project is by using the application yourself. Become familiar with the interface and identify any key features you feel are missing or should be implemented. Our members are readily available and open to any questions or concerns you may have regarding Easy Cart. Feel free to reach out with questions.

## Specifics
Be specific as to what your pull request, when committed, does to the code. When following the coding style of the project, maintain indentation and include comments so we have a better idea as to what the code is doing. Lastly, take precaution and run some test cases beforehand to ensure your code is viable and working.
